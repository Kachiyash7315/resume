    Iâ€™m currently majoring in finance, with a minor in Japanese, at ABC University. I knew that I wanted to go into accounting from day one, so I chose a university with a strong finance program and a broad alumni network. In fact, I originally heard about this internship from an ABC University alumna: Ella Smith in your marketing department. Because I believe that great accountants also have great communication skills, I decided to hone my language skills, too, by minoring in Japanese. My major has taught me the accounting fundamentals, while my minor has taught me the soft skills necessary to succeed.An intern is a trainee who has signed on with an organisation for a brief period. An intern's goal is to gain work experience, occasionally some university credit, and always an overall feel for the industry they're interning in.

Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

      Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.
      
      There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>
